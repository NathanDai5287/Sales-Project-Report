\subsubsection{Risk 0: Carnival Mis-Scheduling}

Given the busy schedules of CCA students, there is a potential risk that the chosen date and time may not be convenient for all students, leading to lower attendance. The potential impact of this risk is significant. Lower attendance could lead to reduced ticket sales, less engagement, and a less successful event overall.

To mitigate this risk, we have carefully considered the timing of the carnival. We chose a Friday afternoon, a time when students are likely to be more available and less reluctant to stay after school due to the absence of tests or homework due the next day. We also strategically avoided scheduling the carnival on the Friday of finals week, recognizing that students would be too focused on their exams to attend our event. Additionally, we avoided dates when early decision results from universities are released, as this could be a stressful time for many seniors.

By carefully considering the scheduling of the carnival, we aim to maximize attendance and ensure the success of the event.
