\subsubsection{Overall Risk: Insufficient Attendance}

The primary risk we identified in our carnival planning is the potential for insufficient attendance. This overarching risk could have significant implications, including financial loss due to the cost of running the event exceeding the revenue generated, and damage to DECA's brand image if attendees perceive poor value for money.

To mitigate this overall risk, we have identified and addressed several interconnected risks. These include the risk of lack of interest leading to low attendance, for which we have implemented a robust advertising campaign and collaborated with teachers to offer extra credit incentives. We also considered the risk of attendees perceiving poor value for money, and have committed to maintaining transparency in all dealings. Finally, we have strategies in place to address the risk of inadequate advertising and engagement hindering a successful promotion of the event.

By addressing these interconnected risks, we aim to ensure a successful carnival with high attendance, positive attendee experiences, and a strengthened DECA brand image.
