\subsubsection{Risk 6: Suboptimal Location}

We originally wanted to host the carnival in the quad, a central location on campus that would be easily accessible to all students. However, we decided to change locations because the outdoors would be too windy. It was December, and the weather was unpredictable and cold. We were concerned that the wind would blow away our game pieces and decorations. Therefore, we decided to switch indoors. The downside to using a classroom is that there will be fewer people who come to our event. If we positioned ourselves on the quad, then people who are leaving the school will automatically pass by. Now that we are located in a classroom, the people will have to intentionally come to our event, reducing our revenue.

To mitigate this risk, we had to effectively market our event with our location. We set up posters around the school and made announcements to the classes we were in. In our poster, we made sure to clearly show the location and date. The exact poster can be seen in Appendix K. Additionally, we posted an announcement in the daily bulletin, which is a slideshow that is shown to the entire school every day.
