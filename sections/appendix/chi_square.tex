\section{Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test}
\label{appendix:chi_square}

The Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether observed frequencies differ significantly from expected frequencies specified in the null hypothesis. It is a non-parametric test that compares the observed distribution of data with an expected distribution, and it is most commonly used with categorical data. The test statistic is calculated as:

$$\chi^2=\sum\frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

where:
\begin{conditions}
\chi^2 & the test statistic \\
O_i & the observed frequency of outcome $i$ \\
E_i & the expected frequency of outcome $i$
\end{conditions}
