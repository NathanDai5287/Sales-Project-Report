\section{Law of Large Numbers}
\label{appendix:large_numbers}

The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics. It states that as the size of a sample increases, the sample mean will get closer to the expected value of the population. In other words, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

Mathematically, if $X_1, X_2, X_3...X_n$ are independent and identically distributed random variables with expected value $E(X_i)=\mu$, then the Law of Large Numbers is expressed as:

$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+...X_n)=\mu$$
